# Traffic Light with React

### Let's simulate a traffic light

The whole purpose of the component is displaying a traffic light with red, yellow and green lights.

When any light is clicked (selected) it has to glow, but the other lights have to stop glowing.

The component must have a state that stores the current color that should be glowing.
